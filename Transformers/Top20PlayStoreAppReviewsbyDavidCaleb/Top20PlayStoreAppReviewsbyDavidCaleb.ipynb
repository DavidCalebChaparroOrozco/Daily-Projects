Last August, a problem arose, that is, when I enter the email, a window appears for me (We sent a code to your email), knowing that my accounts are for Dropbox and not a regular email, but since my accounts are for Dropbox and not regular emails, I do not receive anything, and since then I have not been able to use my Dropbox accounts until now. I hope to solve the problem as soon as possible.Thanks\n",

      "Text Good for what it does, but a few issues. One I noticed is that the app version does not let you delete (remove from your view, and storage quota) folders shared by others, only your own. Option greyed out or missing altogether in the appropriate contexts. This is not the case with the web version, so a bug. UPDATE: recommendation in review feedback made no difference, but I see there is a \"remove from my Dropbox\" option in \"Manage access\" so perhaps more of a terminology issue across platforms.\n",

    "### Key Points to Highlight from the Model Evaluation Output\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "- **True Negatives (TN)**: 3702 reviews correctly identified as negative.\n",
    "- **False Positives (FP)**: 516 reviews incorrectly identified as positive.\n",
    "- **False Negatives (FN)**: 967 reviews incorrectly identified as negative.\n",
    "- **True Positives (TP)**: 4815 reviews correctly identified as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Report:\n",
    "- **NEGATIVE Sentiment**:\n",
    "  - **Precision**: 0.79 - The proportion of reviews predicted as negative that are actually negative.\n",
    "  - **Recall**: 0.88 - The proportion of actual negative reviews correctly identified by the model.\n",
    "  - **F1-Score**: 0.83 - The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.\n",
    "  - **Support**: 4218 - The number of actual occurrences of negative reviews in the dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **POSITIVE Sentiment**:\n",
    "  - **Precision**: 0.90 - The proportion of reviews predicted as positive that are actually positive.\n",
    "  - **Recall**: 0.83 - The proportion of actual positive reviews correctly identified by the model.\n",
    "  - **F1-Score**: 0.87 - The harmonic mean of precision and recall for positive reviews.\n",
    "  - **Support**: 5782 - The number of actual occurrences of positive reviews in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall Metrics**:\n",
    "  - **Accuracy**: 0.85 - The proportion of total reviews correctly classified by the model.\n",
    "  - **Macro Avg**:\n",
    "    - **Precision**: 0.85 - The average precision over both classes.\n",
    "    - **Recall**: 0.86 - The average recall over both classes.\n",
    "    - **F1-Score**: 0.85 - The average F1-score over both classes.\n",
    "  - **Weighted Avg**:\n",
    "    - **Precision**: 0.86 - The precision weighted by the number of true instances for each class.\n",
    "    - **Recall**: 0.85 - The recall weighted by the number of true instances for each class.\n",
    "    - **F1-Score**: 0.85 - The F1-score weighted by the number of true instances for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Insights:\n",
    "1. **High Accuracy**: An overall accuracy of 85% indicates that the model performs well in predicting the sentiment of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision and Recall Balance**: \n",
    "   - The model has a higher precision for positive reviews (0.90) compared to negative reviews (0.79), suggesting that when the model predicts a review as positive, it is very likely to be correct.\n",
    "   - The recall for negative reviews (0.88) is higher than for positive reviews (0.83), indicating that the model is better at identifying negative reviews correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F1-Score**: \n",
    "   - The F1-score is higher for positive reviews (0.87) than for negative reviews (0.83), indicating better overall performance in predicting positive sentiment.\n",
    "   - The balanced F1-scores suggest the model is performing consistently across both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**:\n",
    "   - There are fewer false positives (516) compared to false negatives (967), meaning the model is more likely to miss positive reviews than to incorrectly classify negative reviews as positive."
