0baf4f2b-3924-41cb-a36f-a008ae677beb,Why am I still getting notifications for a chat group I blocked? I blocked a scam group I did not request to be added to and did not accept the invitation to but even after blocking it I continue to be inundated with notifications from them. I cannot find the group by searching because they are blocked. I cannot send a message to the group to have myself removed because they are blocked. What else is there for me except to uninstall the app everywhere?!,1

The only complaint I have is that sometimes, the app signs me out. I've also downloaded the Microsoft Safety app recently so Microsoft has made an account for me. It should be able to recognize the same email that I have in Skype but no. It has created a new account which isn't the one I use so its really hard to sign in and I really hate it.",3
