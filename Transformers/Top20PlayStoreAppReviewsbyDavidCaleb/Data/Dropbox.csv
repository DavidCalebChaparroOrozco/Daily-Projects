eebd3e05-3d39-4613-922f-92623b6bca76,"I've been a long-time Dropbox user, but their recent practices are disappointing. The constant barrage of upgrade emails is harassment. The advertised storage limits are deceptive; file sizes are manipulated to make you run out of space quickly, pushing you to pay for more storage. This feels like a deliberate attempt to make users spend money. Dropbox's approach to storage management and aggressive marketing is frustrating. I would not recommend Dropbox for fair and transparent cloud storage",1

Drop box a must have for many reasons for the many things it can do for you. Don't get caught with out a app that you need to open a file to play a clip or move. And even send to printer. Drop Box has you covered . AA+++,5

738abf19-4e36-4c93-a87b-3384adcc94b4,I was extremely excited about this app. I have an SD card and I had to transfer all my pictures and videos to Dropbox through my computer because my folders were too large. I spent 3 days uploading. After it was all done there were so many things missing in the folders. It was such a joke and a waste of time. This was the 4th cloud service I tried out. And I had high hopes for this one because it was the most user-friendly of them all for what I needed done. Now I'm back to square one,1

a997e96b-7147-43ea-b9e1-dbcf3a2d2736,Horrifically bad. I stored some photos from my old phone on Dropbox. Recently I got an external hardrive and just needed to move about 1.3 gigs of photos from my Dropbox to my HDD. Nope! The Dropbox website refuses to download them. I tried downloading the desktop app. Nope! There is an unexplained sign in error. My last ditch effort is to download them on my phone using the mobile app. Unnacceptable. It should not take 2+ hours just to download MY FILES that I OWN on to MY OWN device!,1

Visiting your aunt in Uzbekistan? No problem. Access all your family pics and videos 24/7. Need to transfer a large video file? It's as easy as dropping a file into a folder.

In the app we don't even have the ability to 'select all' within a folder to download. You have to click on each file individually.

If you are forced to use it for work I strongly suggest the trial only and to make back up copies of everything, using any of the other cloud storage options.

Taking away features in order to make the app behave differently than PC is just actively trying to make your app worse for no reason. Why do you think fewer features is better? Who let you guys develop anything?,1

I then saved the file on my computer and did save it.I went back to my phone and it asked me to save the file. I did and it appears to have overwritten the changes that I made on the computer. No warning. I think that the work around will be to NOT connect to the wi-fi when I next start up the computer so that the changes I made are not overwritten then save the file under a different name,2

2089d30a-f7f9-46cf-b014-f9cc25c71173,Microsoft and google drive has way more features and sync options and that too at an incredibly affordable pricing. So why should I use dropbox premium than? Ofcourse dopbox has some perks but still the pricing factor is a big no for me and that too only for storage. I will have to think again. Dropbox is still very good and I mostly use this for storing temporary important files.,3

But the app (I 'm on Android) is rubbish. It's such hard work. My recommendation would be to use Drop Box on your phone and use the web version. Maybe if you have 1 folder with pictures in that you want to share it would work, otherwise drop the app and use it via the web",1

Why have you removed it Dropbox, hopefully others feel as I do and will pull the plug. Telling me to reach out to the community etc isn't going to bring my albums back is it ?",1

If I just keep the app in my recent apps, the video will play from the beginning and not from the same point. Everything is great but the video service should be improved",3
