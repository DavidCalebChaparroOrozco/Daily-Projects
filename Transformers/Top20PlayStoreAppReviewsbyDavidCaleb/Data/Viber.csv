Not all calls go through, my phone identifies it as spam half the time, and to retry or try sms option you have to wait 30 seconds. Besides that the user experience is mediocre with ads. With alternatives freely available and working way better than this app, I do not recommend it. Edit: tranfer worked, it just took forever. Very poor verification execution.",1

They only appear once when i enter the app, but i believe i don't have to explain why its useless. When sending photos, they mix. It became so laggy for no reason, and all these adds...

It is very clear to me, that notes are off. But there is no option to hide this reminder, there is only option to turn it on!!! I get told, what I MUST do? Otherwise all is great and works well, but this ""must turn on"" thing ruins my mood And yes all notes and reminders and other stuff - I have blocked ALL from app settings!.",2

We compared it to 20 popular chat/call apps using the Pixel 8 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and S24 Ultra. - It sends and receives messages later than others, even on the same WiFi or 5G connection. - When sending multiple photos, it scatters them one by one rather than in a collage format (like Telegram, etc.). - The advertisements are obtrusive. - It needs a complete UI overhaul Viber, wake up!",1

Viber as well, should include.. again.. suggesting the internal screenlock for its app. Overall, love how they added ""Folders"" to manage chat. I think, they should add more folders to manage some of the chats. Thank you! Hope this will be considered.",3

01fcdfcd-22a6-4fa9-a724-8c67d610b670,Rakuten Viber Messenger is an internal competition between developers and corporate desires to be a payment solution. It seems that everybody working for the company lost at least half of their brain power somewhere along 2020-2024. Now the company has literal zombie army of developers and it really shows on the app itself.,1

I mean, organizing them as our priorities would be great.",5

I still don't know how that happened as no one invited them to join. - I keep receiving stupid notifications from Viber about stickers and all kinds of other b*****its, and there is no way to opt out of them or at least to mute them. - I've tried to contact customer service about these issues. No reply whatsoever.",1
