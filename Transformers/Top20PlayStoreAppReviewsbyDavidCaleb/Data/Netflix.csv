a0848668-8f0e-4013-bd44-c1648c03e7e6,You want me to $31.47 A month to use three TVs that are all using the same internet on the same piece of property with the exact same address. So I got to pay $15.49 a month plus $7.99 a month per room. This is wild. Maybe it's because I use a Wi-Fi extender on two TVs and not on the other one because I don't need to. Not really sure but I don't use you enough to even pay you for one TV. There was a Fourth TV I forgot about but I booted them off for you so Maybe you can help me?,1
