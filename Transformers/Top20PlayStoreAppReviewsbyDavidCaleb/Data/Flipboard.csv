Blocking source is easy, but blocking topics is a placebo. Topic filtering needs to be keyword based outside of stories. Example: in every story about Twitter, I'm never able to block that as a topic. A safe assumption is that outlets can pay so their subject cannot be blocked. Also sometimes I block a topic (i.e. India) but it will continue to show stories and sources from and about India.",3

You'll be signing away your online permissions to literally thousands of dodgy companies as you flip and click on stories. It sends you a vast amount of highly suspect sources which often cannot be described as news. Also features highly repetetive scam ads where you'll be presented with exactly the same ad every 6 or 7 'flips' for example an ad that says you can remove ads on your phone by sticking a paperclip into it.

6e9d086f-5523-44d8-b394-89efb35be9b4,Enjoy the app a great deal. Best features include the ability to Follow Magazines/ Topics and file articles away to read later. Suggestion: Add a folders feature to the 'Following' page so magazines can be grouped by topic. Sometimes i hesitate to follow more stuff because the Following page becomes too congested and too annoying to organize. If i could create separate folders for topics that interest me that world be great. I think others would love this feature as well.,5

There is only one point of view represented 99% of the time. Shameful for an app claiming to be news. Should be classified as propaganda. They post a couple dozen articles a day about anecdotal situations involving black and white people in confrontation. Stories that get easily led people riled up against conservatives. They are hurting race relations in U.S. so much. Horrible.,1

Pros: Wide variety of options to choose from, as well as a variety of sources. Cons: Too many of the sources are obviously not US-based, like I would prefer.

895434ee-1e31-41fa-ad69-e8e7e3ddfa36,I've used Flipboard for many years. Up until now it has been my main news app. Unfortunately I stopped using it and deleted the app after the slow decline over the past few years. It all started when they decided to include blogs and opinion editorials. There's just so much junk to weed through. Blogs and such are usually tied to a major news organization.... and Flipboard won't allow you to block individual bloggers... it makes you block everything that comes from that news outlet.,3

d76b48fb-f425-4cbd-a70c-bba1afcd59f3,It's my absolute favorite app for reading a variety of articles and I love flipping through them. The past week or two has driven me absolutely bonkers though. There must have been a recent update that has created a miserable user experience. Some of the ads click through when you are flipping. You're not double clicking the ad... Just flipping through the articles. It's a really evil way to get click-throughs in my opinion. I'm hoping you will get rid of this change soon!,2

20060e3c-0a8e-49c4-848a-cfa01c001c4c,While Flipboard is good at aggregating news and is easily customizable the biggest drawback is the HUGE amount of data it sucks up. This app is a DATA HOG! Even with minimal usage while roaming it consistently consumes an average of 70%-80% of my monthly data plan. IMO it's because of the amount of ads it lets through and lack of control to block them. Altho does have a very crude control to stop videos\images from loading it renders the app useless since it's too difficult to know the content.,3

Ads coming up I didn't click on; I'd wait around for a fix, but now it seems I'm mostly getting extreme one sided leaning opinion pieces. If it's an algorithm giving me articles based on the way it thinks I lean politically, then it's way off. I like reading what the other side thinks to get different perspectives, but good grief. Gave a second star because I actually found one objectively written piece that didn't lean one way or the other.",2
