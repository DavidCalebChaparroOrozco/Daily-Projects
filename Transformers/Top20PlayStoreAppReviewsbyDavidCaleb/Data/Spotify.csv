4f2c5e60-8a6a-42c2-9b2f-98d061eed509,The recent updates feature is very bad. The shuffle feature completely ignores my saved preferences and plays random songs I've never listened to. This change is not only frustrating but also disrespectful to long-time users. It's clear that Spotify cares more about pushing new features than listening to its user base. I'm considering switching to a different music platform entirely. Please revert back to the previous version or at least give us the option to disable this awful update.,1

But, you don't need Premium to hear songs on your Laptop or your Tv since you CAN choose any songs you want to play on it but ads will pop up at times and not always. But, it just annoys me that there's not much songs that has Lyrics. you can just literally search up the Lyrics in Google and put it in Spotify or something",2

When I first got it there was some adds here and there and you could listen to an album in order and read lyrics whenever you wanted without premium. BUT now you get to listen select songs you want a day. You don't get just the album you want. You can't listen on loop. Can't download songs. CANT even read lyrics!

Secondly if you dont have premium you cant listen to the songs you want even if its in your playlist, its annoying for an app to keep pushing for you to pay for something that doesnt work even if you uninstall the app it still doesnt work.

96ff6bc8-54b1-4ebe-9d23-ae7750d47386,would've been great if they didn't feel the sudden need to raise the subscription prices. i doubt many people have the extra money to expend on a TWELVE DOLLAR subscription for a music app. especially when the features premium offers were hardly even worth ten. why is it a premium feature to just.. play a specific song? why do you force songs onto playlists if there's only a few songs? why are LYRICS locked behind a paywall? this is stuff most other FREE music apps offer with no problem.,2

0a2cafe1-c964-453b-9c1e-63b049842f7f,The reason why I'm giving this two stars is for multiple reasons 1 if you search up a song and click on it it will not play the song YOU want. It will make a playlist based on that song. 2 if you don't have premium you can't choose which song you want to be played on your playlist which I very much dislike. All in all I would rather use YouTube music as I can listen to my music in the order that is more enjoyable and in my opinion less adds.,2

The app is also really good at recommending new artists/albums you may not have heard and thus puts you on to some good, new music.

2d766b67-fb31-4b33-81bd-9e7dc697ea29,"The main gripe is the free version being genuine dogshit. Occasional ads? Fair enough. Ads every 2 songs? Not okay. Always forcing shuffle mode when you want to just listen to an playlist in it's intended order? Lobotomite behavior. Toss in only 6 skips per hour and my opinion can hardly get any lower. In conclusion, I believe that whoever decided that these changes need to be implemented should have teeth bludgeoned out, gain full-body excoriation to the muscle and get tossed into the sea :)",1

If you are willing to spend a few bucks I think this is one of the best. I used other platforms but always felt like Spotify was better. It is like an all in one app that does everything to make your listening experience the best. You get curated playlists according to your taste which is great. Spotify connect is a cherry on top. Highly recommended !,4

You'll constantly get ads, no matter what trick you try. They say you'll get 30 minutes of no ads, but that's just a flat out lie. 30 seconds after they say that you'll get like, 5 more ads.

9d7903a6-7792-4e69-b276-2328796a0e60,Issues with inability to play music and stating I am offline when I have 5 bars or WiFi. Continuous popups in the app of recommendations. Seems like the app is getting more bloated as time moves on.,3

I'll change to 5 stars you reply.",1
