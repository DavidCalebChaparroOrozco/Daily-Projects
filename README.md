  * In today's session, we explore how to create contour plots in Matplotlib, a powerful visualization tool in Python. Contour plots allow us to represent 3D functions in 2D, providing a clear view of the function's behavior over a plane. We will generate 2D grids using `numpy.meshgrid` and define various 3D functions to visualize. The session includes creating both surface plots and filled contour plots using Matplotlib's `plot_surface` and `contourf` functions, respectively. This exercise will help you understand how to effectively visualize complex functions, enhancing your data presentation skills and making your plots more informative and visually appealing.
* Day 65: Technical Test "isValidParentheses" and "MergeTwoSortedLists" [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/).
  * isValidParentheses: Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:
      * Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
      * Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
      * Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type. 
      [Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

* Day 68: Recursion "SierpinskiTriangle" and "FractalTree".
  * On day 68, we explore the concept of recursion through the creation of two classic fractals: the Sierpinski Triangle and the Fractal Tree. Both examples utilize Python's turtle graphics library to visualize the recursive processes.
    * Sierpinski Triangle: This fractal is formed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller triangles. Each subdivision step reduces the size of the triangles and changes their color based on the recursion depth. This exercise helps in understanding how recursion can break down complex problems into simpler, repeatable tasks.

    * Fractal Tree: This fractal simulates the natural growth patterns of a tree. Starting with a trunk, the tree branches into smaller sub-branches, each at a specific angle and length decrement. By adjusting the recursion depth, angle, and length decrement, different tree shapes and complexities can be generated. This project emphasizes the power of recursion in modeling natural phenomena and visualizing algorithmic patterns.
* Day 69: Ticket management GUI
  * On day 69, we delve into building a web-based Ticket Management System using Flask. This project includes two primary interfaces: one for clients to generate tickets for order claims, and another for providers to manage and track the tickets. The client-side allows users to enter their name, generate a ticket with a unique number, and record the time of generation. The provider-side interface displays the next ticket in the queue along with the current ticket being attended to and which counter is handling it. This system demonstrates the basics of web development with Flask, including form handling, data storage, and dynamic content rendering. By completing this project, you will gain practical experience in creating web applications, managing state, and ensuring smooth interactions between different user roles. 🧾🖥️✨
