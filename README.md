# Daily-Projects
This repository contains my daily projects, challenging me to create something new every day. From small utilities to full-fledged applications, they reflect my growth as a developer. Each project has a brief description of technologies, challenges and lessons. It is a record of my progress and a constantly evolving portfolio.
* Day 01:  Polar Plots in Python with Matplotlib by Neural Nine
  * Today we learn how to work with polar coordinates and how to create polar plots in Python using Matplotlib.
* Day 02: Spotify Oldies Dataset ðŸŽ¶: A Treasury of Classics [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/spotify-oldies-dataset/data)
  * Today I'm going to work with a dataset called Spotify Oldies Dataset: A Treasury of Classics.
* Day 03: Pomodoro Timer GUI
  * In this project, I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Pomodoro Timer using Tkinter in Python. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This GUI application allows users to start, reset, and skip timers for Pomodoro sessions, short breaks, and long breaks, providing visual feedback on the remaining time for each interval. It serves as a practical tool for enhancing productivity and focus during work or study sessions.
* Day 04: To Do App
  * Today, I created a To Do application using Flask and SQLAlchemy. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed or in progress. Users can also search and filter tasks by various criteria such as title, completion status, priority, and due date. Additionally, the app supports sorting tasks by ID, title, or completion status, and offers bulk actions to mark tasks as completed, in progress, or not completed. It's a simple yet practical tool for managing daily tasks efficiently.
* Day 05: ContactManager
  * This project involves creating a contact manager application using Python's Tkinter library. The ContactManager allows users to add, edit, view, and delete contacts. It provides features such as pagination, searching, importing/exporting contacts from/to CSV files, and input validation for contact details. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing contact information effectively.
* Day 06: Income Prediction Adult Income [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset)
  * In today's project, I implemented a machine learning model to predict adult income using the Adult Income dataset. The dataset contains various demographic and employment-related features such as age, education level, occupation, and work hours per week, along with the target variable indicating whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually. I utilized the Random Forest algorithm to train the model and extracted feature importance scores to identify the key factors influencing income prediction. The model achieved an accuracy of  0.86%, demonstrating its capability to classify individuals into different income groups. This project enhances my understanding of supervised learning techniques and their application in real-world scenarios.
