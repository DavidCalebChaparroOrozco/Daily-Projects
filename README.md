# Daily-Projects
This repository contains my daily projects, challenging me to create something new every day. From small utilities to full-fledged applications, they reflect my growth as a developer. Each project has a brief description of technologies, challenges and lessons. It is a record of my progress and a constantly evolving portfolio.
* Day 01:  Polar Plots in Python with Matplotlib by Neural Nine
  * Today we learn how to work with polar coordinates and how to create polar plots in Python using Matplotlib.
* Day 02: Spotify Oldies Dataset ðŸŽ¶: A Treasury of Classics [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/spotify-oldies-dataset/data)
  * Today I'm going to work with a dataset called Spotify Oldies Dataset: A Treasury of Classics.
* Day 03: Pomodoro Timer GUI
  * In this project, I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Pomodoro Timer using Tkinter in Python. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This GUI application allows users to start, reset, and skip timers for Pomodoro sessions, short breaks, and long breaks, providing visual feedback on the remaining time for each interval. It serves as a practical tool for enhancing productivity and focus during work or study sessions.
* Day 04: To Do App
  * Today, I created a To Do application using Flask and SQLAlchemy. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed or in progress. Users can also search and filter tasks by various criteria such as title, completion status, priority, and due date. Additionally, the app supports sorting tasks by ID, title, or completion status, and offers bulk actions to mark tasks as completed, in progress, or not completed. It's a simple yet practical tool for managing daily tasks efficiently.
* Day 05: ContactManager
  * This project involves creating a contact manager application using Python's Tkinter library. The ContactManager allows users to add, edit, view, and delete contacts. It provides features such as pagination, searching, importing/exporting contacts from/to CSV files, and input validation for contact details. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing contact information effectively.
* Day 06: Income Prediction Adult Income [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset)
  * In today's project, I implemented a machine learning model to predict adult income using the Adult Income dataset. The dataset contains various demographic and employment-related features such as age, education level, occupation, and work hours per week, along with the target variable indicating whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually. I utilized the Random Forest algorithm to train the model and extracted feature importance scores to identify the key factors influencing income prediction. The model achieved an accuracy of  0.86%, demonstrating its capability to classify individuals into different income groups. This project enhances my understanding of supervised learning techniques and their application in real-world scenarios.
* Day 07: Pokedex GUI Application
  * In this project, I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) application for a Pokedex using Python's Tkinter library. The Pokedex is a digital encyclopedia that catalogues information about different species of PokÃ©mon, a popular franchise of fictional creatures.
* Day 08: Flet Chat Application
  * Created a chat application using Flet library in Python. This application allows users to join a chat room, send and receive messages in real-time. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying chat messages, input field for sending messages, and user authentication. The application utilizes Flet components for UI design and integrates functionalities for sending, receiving, and displaying messages efficiently. It serves as a practical tool for real-time communication and collaboration among users.
* Day 09: Video Game Sales [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data)
  * Today's project delves into the world of video game sales analysis. Leveraging the Video Game Sales dataset from Kaggle, I explore trends and patterns in the gaming industry. This dataset contains information on video game sales across different platforms, regions, genres, and years, providing valuable insights into consumer preferences and market dynamics. Through data exploration, visualization, and potentially predictive modeling, I aim to uncover hidden gems and understand what makes a successful video game title. Stay tuned for the journey through pixels and polygons! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
* Day 10: Summarize News Articles
  * Worked on a project to summarize news articles using web scraping and natural language processing libraries like newspaper3k and TextBlob.
* Day 11: Sudoku Solver
  * In this project, I've crafted a Sudoku solver leveraging the backtracking algorithm in Python. This application empowers users to input incomplete Sudoku puzzles, generating a valid solution for the board. To enhance user experience, I integrated the Tkinter graphical library to craft an interactive interface. Through this interface, users can input Sudoku numbers and witness the solution unfold step by step. This project not only offers an efficient solution for Sudoku puzzles but also serves as an educational tool to delve into backtracking algorithms and Python-based interactive user interfaces.
* Day 12: Snake Pygame
  * In today's project, I built a classic Snake game using Pygame, a popular Python library for creating 2D games. The Snake game is a timeless arcade classic where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game area.
* Day 13: Titanic Dataset ðŸš¢ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
  * Today, we delve into the exciting world of data analysis with the famous Titanic dataset. This dataset, available on Kaggle, provides information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, including details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare paid, and more. Our task is to explore this dataset, understand its key features, and possibly develop predictive models to determine the likelihood of a passenger's survival based on various factors. Through this project, we will not only enhance our data analysis skills but also honor the memory of the Titanic passengers by extracting meaningful insights from this historic dataset.
* Day 14: Email Python
  * Today's project involves creating a Python script for sending automated emails. Leveraging libraries such as smtplib, schedule, and dotenv, we develop a script capable of sending daily inspirational emails to a specified email address. The script reads quotes from a file, selects a random quote, and sends it via SMTP protocol. Utilizing environment variables for storing email credentials ensures security and flexibility. By scheduling the script to run periodically using the schedule library, we automate the process of sending daily inspiration to recipients, fostering motivation and positivity. This project not only demonstrates practical use cases of Python for automation but also serves as a reminder of the power of uplifting messages in our daily lives.
* Day 15: Guess the Number
  * Today's project involves creating a number guessing game using Python's Tkinter library for building the graphical user interface (GUI). The game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 99 within a limited number of attempts. Through input validation and dynamic feedback, the game guides the player to adjust their guesses until they either correctly identify the number or exhaust their attempts. This project not only showcases interactive GUI development with Tkinter but also reinforces concepts of random number generation, user input handling, and game logic implementation. It provides an entertaining and engaging experience for players while honing programming skills in Python. Can you beat the odds and guess the secret number? Let the guessing game begin! ðŸŽ²
* Day 16: Virtual Bookshelves
  * In this project, I'll create a virtual bookshelf management system using Python and SQLite. The application will allow users to add, remove, update, and view books in their virtual bookshelves. Each book will have attributes such as title, author, year published, and genre. The system will utilize SQLite for database management and provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the bookshelves. This project aims to simulate real-world bookshelf management scenarios and provide users with a convenient way to organize their reading materials. Let's embark on the journey of building virtual bookshelves to enhance our reading experiences! ðŸ“šâœ¨
